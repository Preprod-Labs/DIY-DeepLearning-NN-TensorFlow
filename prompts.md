## Code Explanation

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

- **`load_data(path)`**: Loads and preprocesses image data from the specified directory.
- **`process_image(img_path, x_dataset, y_dataset, label)`**: Processes a single image and appends it to the dataset.

### Model Creation

- **`create_model(learning_rate)`**: Creates and compiles a Convolutional Neural Network model.

### Training and Evaluation

- **`plot_training_history(history)`**: Plots the training history of the model.
- **`StreamlitCallback`**: Custom Keras callback to update Streamlit UI during training.

### Prediction

- **`preprocess_image(image_path)`**: Preprocesses a single image for prediction.
- **`display_prediction(image_path, predicted_class, prediction)`**: Displays the prediction result for a single image.

### Main Function

- **`main()`**: Sets up the Streamlit UI, including configuration and training sections, and allows users to make predictions on new images.
